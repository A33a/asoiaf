# Graph theory in A Game of Thrones
Statistics of "A Song Of Ice And Fire" based on graph theory. The graph of characters' connections is extracted from 5 first books using machine learning by [Erik Germani](http://atseajournal.com/asoiaf/). The graph algorithms are implemented in C++.
## Algorithms used in analysis
###BFS
The breadth-first search algorithm is used to calculate the diameter of the graph and farthest path for all vertices and the average of it. 
###DFS
The depth-first search algorithm is used to calculate the amount of connected components in the graph.
###Bron-Kerbosch algorithm
Used for calculating the maximal cliques in the graph.
###Kruskalâ€™s algorithm
Used for building the spanning tree of the graph.
